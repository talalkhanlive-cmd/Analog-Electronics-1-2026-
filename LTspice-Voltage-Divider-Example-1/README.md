# LTspice Example 1 – Simple Resistive Voltage Divider

**Student Name:** Talal Khan  

## Objective
To draw and simulate a simple resistive voltage divider circuit in LTspice
based on the reference example provided in the LTspice manual.

## Circuit Description
The circuit consists of:
- A DC voltage source of 10 V
- Two resistors R1 and R2, each of 1 kΩ
- Ground reference

The output voltage is taken across resistor R2.

## Simulation Details
- Simulation type: Transient analysis
- Time interval: 0 to 100 ms

## Files Included
- voltage_divider.asc – LTspice schematic file
- schematic.png – Screenshot of the LTspice schematic window
- simulation.png – Screenshot of the simulation result

## Result
The simulation confirms voltage division across the resistors. Since R1 and R2
have equal resistance values, the output voltage is approximately half of the
input voltage.
